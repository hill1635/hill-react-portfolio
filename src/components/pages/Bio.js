      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello World!  I am a Full-Stack Developer with five months of experience.  I am currently enrolled in the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp and on track to graduate in March.  My front-end wheelhouse is in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  My CSS background expands to the Bootstrap framework.  Javscript libraries learned include jQuery and React as well as server-side technologies such as AJAX and APIs.  On the back-end, I am knowledgeable in the Node.js environment and server creation with Node, Express and HTTP.  Database construction with MySQL, MongoDB, and IndexedDB using ORM and MVC techniques with Sequelize and Mongoose.  Sprinkle on top of that some testing with Jest and Progressive Web Apps with Webpack and that sums up the past five months for me!</p>
      <p>My goal as a Developer is to continue honing my current skills and becoming one step closer to mastery.  In addition to this, I strive to continue learning new skills, technologies and languages.  Coding is a continually evolving craft and the sheer amount of tools out there to learn is incredibly exciting as one who is always looking to push myself further and grow.  Flexibility is also key to providing clients with the best options suited to their specific needs.</p>
      <p>Though my professional experience mainly revolves around the Hospitality industry, it was there that I caught the coding bug (though I did not realize it at the time).  Two words: Excel spreadsheets.  They quickly became a useful tool to organize office work and, quite frankly, turned into a little bit of a guilty pleasure.  As I moved up through the years and took on new challenges, I found more uses for them and the spreadsheets grew larger and the formulas more complicated.  There was nothing more frustrating than putting in a lot of time and effort and not have it work, but nothing more satisfying and rewarding than grinding away at it and getting it to produce the desired results.  This has, in essence, been the continual theme throughout the bootcamp course and has further entrenched the feeling that This Is The Place for me (just a little Utah history reference there - what can I say, I love it here).</p>
